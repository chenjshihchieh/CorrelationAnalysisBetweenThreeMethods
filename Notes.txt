- Only include participants with ChangeInLocation Data, FBBias, or MCBias
- Number of data points by year for ChangeInLocation:
	Y1 = 92
	Y2 = 17
	Y3 = 3

- Selected Columns: "PID", "Age", "AverageFBBias", "AverageMCBias", "ChangeInLocation1", "ChangeInLocation2"

- Ran Little's MCAR test to see if the missing values were missing at random. This is to prepare for imputations if necessary/relevant.

Doing three different tests: spearman, kendall, and point biserial (maybe?)

Y1 only and removing failed controls
n = 85

Spearman
- na's are deleted listwise

Between AverageFBBias and ChangeInLocation1
n = 84
